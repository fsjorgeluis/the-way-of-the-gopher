This book aims to be a practical, accessible and high-quality resource to learn Go — from the basics to building real-world cloud-native applications.

Contributions are welcome in the form of:

- Fixes (typos, grammar, broken links)
- New examples or improvements to existing code
- Suggestions for new topics or clarifications
- Translations or enhancements to multi-language support (English/Spanish)

## 📌 Contribution Guidelines

Please follow these general rules when contributing:

### ✅ What We're Looking For

- Clear, concise, and practical code examples in Go
- Content that aligns with the book's four main parts:
  1. Fundamentals of Go
  2. Best practices and architecture
  3. Cloud-native development with AWS
  4. Real-world projects and CI/CD

- Lessons or chapters that:
  - Are driven by solving real problems
  - Emphasize clean code, idiomatic Go, and good design
  - Optionally include tests or benchmark examples

### 🚧 Work in Progress? That’s Okay!

Open a **draft PR early** to get feedback. Don’t worry about perfection:
- You can submit a partial chapter or code snippet.
- Use comments in the PR to ask questions or explain your thinking.
- Discussion is encouraged! Better ideas make the book stronger.

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Style & Format

- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments) for code consistency.
- Prefer simple, focused examples that teach one concept at a time.
- Keep code runnable where possible (i.e., `main()` entry points or test files).
- All examples should compile and pass tests.
- Keep language clear and friendly — this is a book **for humans**, not a dry spec.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Ensure your Go code passes `go test ./...`.
- Use Go modules for reproducibility (`go mod tidy` if needed).
- If submitting CDK or AWS examples, include clear steps to replicate.
